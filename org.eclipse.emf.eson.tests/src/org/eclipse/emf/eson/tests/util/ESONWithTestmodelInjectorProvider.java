/**
 * IInjectorProvider for ESON + TestmodelPackage.
 * 
 * This is needed because the approach of just putting
 * TestmodelPackageImpl.init() into the @Before of a *Test doesn't quite work
 * reliably, it works for one @Test but not several, because "*PackageImpl
 * init() will not always put itself into the registry. It does that only on
 * first call. IRegistryConfigurator . That will create a copy of the registries
 * before each test and set that state back after the test has run." Using @BeforeClass
 * works as well, but completely defeats the purpose.
