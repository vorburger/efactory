ESON was formerly known as EFactory, which originally started out on https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/efactory/.

As of 2014-12, this project has been formally accept and integrated as a sub-project of the official 
Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) on eclipse.org.  Sources here are for source code history forensics, only.

So now SEE http://git.eclipse.org/c/emf/org.eclipse.emf.eson.git/ ...

Live long, and prosper.
